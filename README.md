Scene Recognition
-----------------

Scene recognition has been a popular problem in the field of computer vision
and as such was a popular topic in our Intro to Computer Vision class (cs4476)
offered at Georgia Tech. 

This topic covered two of our projects in the class. Both attempted to classify
images in the 15 scene database and acheived various accuracies. Both are written
in MATLAB, and include a writeup about their results. The first method involves
a bag of words model, while the second explored deep learning techniques.

Some of this code was provided to me, but much of it is mine. The next goal is to
port the work done here into python code, perhaps using Google's tensorflow module.
